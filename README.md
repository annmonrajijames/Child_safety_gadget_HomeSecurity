# Child_safety_gadget_HomeSecurity
Child safety gadget is a home security device which ensures the safety of the child when the child reaches home by providing acknowledgement to the parents who are not at home.

## Child safety gadget 1.0
Child safety gadget 1.0 is a device, to provide acknowledgement to parents through email to notify that child reached home after the child enters correct password on the keypad, and the led will blink green light and an email will be sent to parents mobile. If the password is wrong, wrong passcode entered email will be sent and red led will blink. The child can enter a pseudo-passcode which is a different password if the child feels threatened and this will send an SOS email to parents but the device will blink green light to fool the criminal to believe that the child entered the correct passcode. 
The components of project are ES8266 microcontroller, Keypad, RGB Led light, Jumper wires. IoT platform Blynk 2.0 is also used. 

## Child safety gadget 2.0
Child safety gadget 2.0, brings camera feature to the device where it will take a picture and sends the picture to Google drive when someone comes near the device. An IR sensor is used for this, as the child enters the password the IR sensor which is placed near the device will get activated and will send the picture to parents Google drive. 
The components used in this project are ESP32CAM, IR sensor, FTDI232 (only while uploading the code), Jumper wires and Breadboard.
